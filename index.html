            <h4> Hello! </h4>
              <p> My name is Tina Johnson and I am a software developer from Jacksonville, Florida. I am currently a student looking to start a new career and I can not wait to learn the ins and outs of this exciting new field. </p>

            <h2> About Me </h2>
               <p> For the last 10 years I have been a pastry chef and, while I am proud of my career and the work I have done, I have made the decision to pursue a career in software engineering. Growing up, I was raised by my grandparents and my grandfather has been in IT since computers took up entire rooms and, as a Senior Programming Analyst, he has a real passion for his work. When I made the decision to change careers, the first thing I thought of was computer science because I know how much my grandfather loves it and I would hope to have even a fraction of his passion for my work.</p>
               <p> I am now enrolled in college to receive my bachelors in Computer Science while also attending the Thinkful software engineering boot camp. The more I learn, the more I am seeing a satisfying and productive career ahead of me. As someone who both loves puzzles and being creative, I am loving the new challenges I am facing every day.</p>
               <p> If you are looking for a new developer or have any learning opportunities to offer a student, please feel free to reach out to me. I can't wait to start working as a new professional in this field!</p>
